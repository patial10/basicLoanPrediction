# Loan_Prediction
This is basic end to end web application which predicts a person eligible to take loan or not on the basis their information.and the Information is 
Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.and here's the my approch to build it:

1. Take the data and analyse it
2. Pass the data through a feature engineering pipeline.
3. Train a machine learning model on the engineered features.
4. Deploy the trained model as an API

# Dataset
